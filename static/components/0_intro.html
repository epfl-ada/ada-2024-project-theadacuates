    <h2><strong>Main Question:</strong> <br>
      Is Cognitive Fatigue Quantifiable in Wikispeedia, and What Role Does It Play in Gameplay?
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Recent studies show that our attention spans are shrinking, and our brains can become fatigued within minutes of focused activity 
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.12339" target="_blank">(1)</a>. 
      This project aims to investigate user engagement with the  
      <b>Wikispeedia game from a neuroscientific angle</b>, focusing on how article complexity impacts cognitive load and behavior. Key questions include:
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
          <li>How does the complexity of articles affect user engagement?</li>
          <li>Does the structure and layout (e.g., headings, multimedia) influence time spent, back-clicks, or path abandonment?</li>
          <li>Are there biological biases that influence the gameplay?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    </p>
    The dataset used in the analysis can be found in <a href="https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wikispeedia.html" target="_blank">here</a> and includes the paths of approximately 75,000 games, 
    along with ancillary information such as the game’s rating and the number of backclicks.

    - finshed/unifhesd as proxy for mental fatigue
    - motvation can be regressed out as simialr to eahcplayer. We assume that poelaie ghave all same motioa +  diffcult to measyre mtovaiton in rnetscience (link article)
    - impossible to traks user thrieug time due to IP address (link to exmplamntion)
    Each path, i.e. list of articles from source to target, could either be <strong>finished or unfinished</strong>, 
    depending on whether the user completes the mission. 
    This distinction is particularly important, as unfinished paths will be used as <strong>proxies for mental fatigue</strong>.

    <h3>Meet Our Characters:</h3>
    <div> 
        <strong>Pepito</strong> is a young neuroscience student with big dreams and... 
        <strong>questionable study habits</strong>. 
        Last week, he faced an unexpected academic crisis—not in the lab, 
        but in a game called Wikispeedia. The result? <strong>Pepito got lost</strong>. 
        A lot. Like, "How did I end up reading about Cabbage Moths?" lost. <br>
        Embarrassed but determined, Pepito boldly blamed the game, not himself. 
        <strong>"It’s not me—it’s cognitive overload! This game would exhaust even the sharpest minds."<br>
        </strong> But Pepito's mentor, the legendary <strong>Dr. Ramón y Cajal</strong>, wasn’t buying it.
        Known for spotting an excuse from a mile away, Dr. Cajal challenged Pepito to prove his claims with data. <br>
        What follows is a heated back-and-forth between Pepito and Dr. Cajal. 
        Could Pepito’s data reveal the game’s inherent challenge, or would Dr. Cajal’s <strong>“study harder” mantra</strong> prevail?

        <h1>Wikispeedia</h1>
        <p>
          Wikispeedia is a human-computation game in which users are asked to navigate from a given source to a given target article by only clicking Wikipedia links.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game is playable at the following <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/play/" target="_blank">link</a>, while the dataset, comprising human navigation paths on Wikipedia along with some other metrics, is available <a href="https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wikispeedia.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, for a detailed analysis of the dataset, please refer to the following <a href="https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2024-project-theadacuates/blob/main/src/notebooks/1_EDA.ipynb" target="_blank">notebook</a>.
