        <h2>Pepito's Simple Mental Fatigue Metrics</h2>
        <p>
            Pepito and Dr. Cajal prepare to tackle a new question: what role do time spent and path length play in shaping a player’s journey? With curiosity and resolve, the two dive into the details of these key factors.

            Time reflects how long a player persists, while path length captures the number of steps needed to complete a path. Pepito and Dr. Cajal seek to discover how these elements contribute to success or failure when playing Wikispeedia. Are longer paths or extended durations the breaking point for players, or is the truth more complex?

                I will now show a plot of the duration of paths for both finished and unfinished cases. Look at this chart! The blue line represents the durations for finished paths, while the orange line shows the durations for unfinished ones. It is clear that unfinished paths tend to take much longer, with their average duration (marked by the orange dashed line) being significantly higher than that of finished paths (blue dashed line).

                See, the mean duration of unfinished paths (orange line) is much higher compared to finished paths. This means time spent is a reliable predictor of the cognitive load on the person, and thus, the rate of abandonment.

                Pepito, please! Don’t you see what a strange distribution you have here? What about the tail for unfinished paths? Here, have a look: if I now take only unfinished paths and split them by their type, i.e., if it's 'abandonment' or 'timeout,' I can clearly see a distinct split. This makes it evident that not all unfinished paths are the same, and understanding these differences is key to interpretation.

            The increased mean duration in these cases is largely due to session timeouts. In these instances, players were not necessarily experiencing difficulty; rather, they abandoned the session, allowing time to accumulate passively. As a result, the prolonged durations in unfinished paths reflect a lapse in activity rather than active engagement or cognitive load.

                Professor, I see your point about unfinished paths. But let’s take a closer look at the path lengths instead. I will plot them now. Here we go : this chart shows the distribution of path lengths for finished and unfinished paths. The blue line represents finished paths, and the orange line shows unfinished ones. Interestingly, the mean path length for finished paths (blue dashed line) is slightly longer than for unfinished paths (orange dashed line). This seems counterintuitive, doesn’t it? Could it be that longer paths (which mean more articles visited) lead to abandonment?
            </p>

                If path length, as you suppose, could influence gameplay (i.e., longer paths are correlated to unfinished paths), I would expect unfinished paths to have a higher average number of articles visited. However, the data shows otherwise. To confirm this, let’s perform a Mann-Whitney U test to statistically compare the path lengths of finished and unfinished paths. The results might give us more clarity on whether the difference is significant.

                Let’s look at the results of the Mann-Whitney U test. The p-value is basically zero, which means there is a clear difference between the path lengths of finished and unfinished games. This is surprising! the average path length for finished games is actually a bit longer than for unfinished ones. So, it seems like having a longer path doesn’t confuse players as much as I thought!
                Professor... I think your analysis may not be entirely correct! It may be that, by chance, finished paths have a source and target link that are structurally distant in the network, elongating the path. This could be a confounding factor!
            </p>

                Pepito, even after regressing out this factor, the conclusion remains unchanged. Let’s look at specific source-target pairs that have been played frequently. As you can see, the difference in means consistently shows that finished paths have longer path lengths. This suggests that players are capable of completing longer paths, and perhaps other factors, such as engagement or familiarity with the topic, play a role in their success. Therefore, path length alone does not fully explain why some paths are abandoned, and a deeper analysis of player behavior is necessary to uncover the underlying reasons.

                <h1>Mann-Whitney U Test Details</h1>
                <p>The Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric test used to compare differences between two independent groups. It is particularly useful when the data do not follow a normal distribution.</p>
                <p>Let’s denote the groups as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Group 1:</strong> Finished paths</li>
                    <li><strong>Group 2:</strong> Unfinished paths</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The U statistic is computed as follows:</p>
                <div class="formula">
                    $$ U = R_1 - \frac{n_1(n_1 + 1)}{2} $$
                </div>
                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>R<sub>1</sub></strong> is the sum of ranks for Group 1.</li>
                    <li><strong>n<sub>1</sub></strong> is the sample size of Group 1.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The p-value is obtained by comparing the U statistic to a reference distribution, adjusted for ties in the ranks if necessary.</p>
                <p>Our results indicate a significant difference in path lengths (p-value < 0.05), confirming that finished paths tend to have longer lengths.</p>
