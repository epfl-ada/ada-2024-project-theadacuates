        <h2>Pepito's Simple Mental Fatigue Metrics</h2>
        <p>
            We all know that tasks that are repeated for long periods or become too complex can lead to confusion and, ultimately, cognitive fatigue. This is what I aim to demonstrate: that both the time taken to complete a path and the length of the path itself play a significant role in gameplay.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since paths can either be completed or left unfinished, I base my argument on the assumption that unfinished paths are often a result of difficulty and the increased cognitive load experienced by the player during the process.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will now show that these two factors—time and path length—are important indicators of cognitive strain in gameplay.

            <strong>Pepito:</strong> See, the mean duration of unfinished paths (orange line) is much higher compared to finished paths. This means time spent is a reliable predictor of the cognitive load on the person, and thus, the rate of abandonment.

            <strong>Dr. Cajal:</strong> Pepito, please!!! Don’t you see what a strange distribution you have? What about the tail for unfinished paths? Here, have a look. If I now take only unfinished paths and color them by the type of unfinished path, i.e., "abandonment" or "timeout," I can clearly see a distinct split.

        <p>
            The increased mean duration in these cases is largely due to session timeouts. In these instances, players were not necessarily experiencing difficulty; rather, they abandoned the session, allowing time to accumulate passively. As a result, the prolonged durations in unfinished paths reflect a lapse in activity rather than active engagement or cognitive load. Thus, any assumptions about cognitive load based on these time differences would be unreliable.

            <strong>Pepito:</strong> As longer paths mean more articles visited, this could lead to confusion in the player's mind. Perhaps is this a cause of path abandonment?

            <strong>Dr. Cajal:</strong> As you talked about path duration, let me now talk about path length. If path length, as you suppose, could influence the gameplay (i.e., longer paths are correlated to unfinished paths), I should observe that unfinished paths have a higher number of articles visited.

            Mann-Whitney U test results for Finished vs. Unfinished Path Lengths:
            <strong>U = 772366749.0, p-value = 0.0</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, and as further validated by the <strong>Mann-Whitney U Test</strong>, your thesis is completely contradicted. <strong>Unfinished paths actually have shorter lengths.</strong>

            <strong>Pepito:</strong> Mr. Cajal, I think your analysis is not entirely correct. Indeed, it may be that, by chance, finished paths have a source and target link that, by the architecture of the network, are far from each other. As a result, the path is elongated due to this structural factor.

            <strong>Dr. Cajal:</strong> Pepito, you are right, but even if I regress out this factor, the conclusion remains the same. Let's take pairs of target and source links that have been played multiple times (for instance, the following four have been played more than 1000 times each). As you can see from the results of the tests, the difference in means between finished and unfinished paths consistently shows that finished paths have a longer path length. However, the confounding factor you cited earlier has already been regressed out.
