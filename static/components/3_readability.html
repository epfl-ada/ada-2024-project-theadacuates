        <h2>Pepito and Readability Metrics</h2>
        <p><strong>"It's just the beginning,"</strong> Pepito thinks, reflecting on Dr. Cajal's earlier comment. 
            Undeterred, he moves forward with his next argument: 
            the  impact of readability metrics on gameplay.
        </p>
        <p>Whether we admit it or not, Wikipedia itself is a game that demands reading. 
            Yet, as articles grow in complexity, they introduce a heavier cognitive load, 
            making the game progressively more challenging. 
            This is the next thesis Pepito presents: the <strong>relationship between article readability 
            and the difficulty of the game.</strong>
        </p>

            <p>Previous studies have shown that <strong>text can lead to mental fatigue</strong>, 
                and readability metrics—such as those used to assess the ease of reading—
                can serve as a proxy to quantify this effect <a href="https://typeset.io/papers/readability-measures-as-predictors-of-understandability-and-4cc738phts" target="_blank">(Ref)</a>. 
                I will demonstrate that higher <strong>article complexity is correlated with path abandonment</strong>,
                suggesting that mental energy is depleted before completing the correct path. 
                <strong>Again, it is not my fault; it is simply how my brain functions.</strong> <br> 

                <div style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px; text-align: center;">
                    <button data-overlay-id="readability" class="button big wide smooth-scroll-middle">Readability Metrics</button>
                    <button data-overlay-id="ttest" class="button big wide smooth-scroll-middle">T-Test</button>
                </div>
                
                To explore this, I will calculate different readability metrics for each article, and then, 
                for each single readability metric, compute the <strong>average value for each path.</strong>
                After performing a <strong>t-test</strong> (please se the table below), I found that, for 2 indices, namely <strong>ARI and the Readability Consensus</strong>, 
                show <strong>statistically significant differences in mean</strong> values between <strong>inished and unfinished paths.</strong> 
                This supports my thesis.

            <strong>¡Híjole! Pepito, where do I even begin?</strong>

            I truly appreciate that you decided to use a statistical test to support your thesis, 
            but in your analysis, you <strong>didn't check if the assumptions of the test were met</strong>. 
            For instance, are you sure that the data is normally distributed in order to apply the t-test?
        
            Fortunately for you, it seems that the data is normally distributed, as shown in the next figure.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 80px; text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/readability_plots.png" alt="Image related to Entropy" style="width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">
    </div>   


    <p>
        In addition, you must always <strong>visualize the data itself</strong>: Yes, there is a significant difference in the results, 
        but <strong>is this difference truly meaningful?</strong>
    
        You need to understand the <strong>difference between statistical significance and practical significance</strong>.    
        <strong>Statistical significance</strong> means that the difference you observed is unlikely to have happened by chance, often indicated by a p-value less than 0.05.
        <strong>Practical significance</strong>, on the other hand, asks whether the observed difference is large enough to have a real-world impact.

        <p>
        Even though your results might be statistically significant (p-value &lt; 0.05), 
        <strong>the actual change in the means is so small (~0.01)</strong> that it would not affect gameplay 
        in any meaningful way. 
        Therefore, these results do not support your theory, Pepito.
        </p>

                    Naturally, <strong>Pepito</strong> wants to calculate, for each index, 
                    the <strong>mean value</strong> for each path. 
                    For example, consider the SMOG index applied to a path that is made up of <strong>["Rome", "Europe", "France", "Paris"]</strong>.
                    Pepito would first calculate the SMOG index for the single articles and then mean those values.

                <h1>What is the T-test?</h1>
                <p>The T-test is a statistical test used to compare the means (averages) of two groups to determine if there is a significant difference between them. It's often used in research to see if a new treatment or condition has an effect compared to a control group.</p>
        
                <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
                <p>The T-test helps us answer questions like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does a new drug have a different effect compared to a placebo?</li>
                    <li>Is there a difference in test scores between two classes?</li>
                    <li>Are two machines producing products with different quality levels?</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <p>The T-test calculates a value called the <strong>t-statistic</strong>, which tells us how different the two groups are. The larger the t-statistic, the greater the difference. The test also considers the variation within each group and the number of samples.</p>
                <p>The formula for calculating the t-statistic depends on the type of T-test, but it generally follows this structure:</p>
                <div class="formula">
                    $$ t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}} $$
                </div>
                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><i>t</i>:</strong> T-statistic value</li>
                    <li><strong><i>&#x0305;X<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>&#x0305;X<sub>2</sub></i>:</strong> The sample means of the two groups</li>
                    <li><strong><i>s<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i> and <i>s<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i>:</strong> The variances of the two groups</li>
                    <li><strong><i>n<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>n<sub>2</sub></i>:</strong> The sample sizes of the two groups</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h2>What does the result mean?</h2>
                <p>The result of the T-test will give us a value called the <strong>p-value</strong>. If the p-value is low (typically below 0.05), it means the difference between the two groups is likely not due to chance, and we can conclude there is a significant difference. If the p-value is high, it suggests there is no significant difference.</p>
        
                <h2>Assumptions of the T-test</h2>
                <p>There are a few assumptions that need to be met for the T-test to be valid:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Independence:</strong> The observations in each group must be independent of each other.</li>
                    <li><strong>Normality:</strong> The data in each group should follow a normal distribution. This is especially important for small sample sizes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equal variance:</strong> The variance of the two groups should be approximately equal. If the variances are unequal, a variation of the T-test, such as Welch’s T-test, should be used.</li>
                </ul>
