        <h2>Pepito's new hope: Cognitive Shifting</h2>
        <p>
            Despite being taken aback by the strong evidence presented by the Professor, Pepito will not be deterred so
            easily.
            Cajal's mention of strategic choices along a path gives Pepito a new idea: measuring the <strong>amount of
                change</strong> along a path.
            He decides to try a new metric, <strong>cognitive shifting</strong>.

            <p>
                <span class="image left"><img src="images/pepito.jpg" /></span>
                When alternative, task-unrelated stimuli are presented to a human, mental fatigue and attention are
                negatively impacted (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26752733/" target="_blank">Ref</a>).
                I believe that <strong>moving from one category of knowledge to another</strong> (e.g., from
                science-related articles to arts-related articles) <strong>requires cognitive shifting</strong>, which
                can <strong>negatively impact gameplay</strong>.
                <br>
                
                Below, we observe the shift in category from source to target link: 
                the <strong>change in category is clearly visible</strong> even with this coarse analysis. 
                Consider how many <strong>subtle shifts might be uncovered if we examine the entire paths</strong> in detail.           
             </p>
        </div>

        <div class="row" style="text-align:center;">
            <div id="img-category-change-count" style="width: 100%;height:30vw; margin-left: 5vw"></div>
        </div>

        <p>
            For each path, I will count the <strong>category changes</strong>, for example if the player is on an
            article categorised "Science" and moves to an article categorised "History", this represents a category
            change.
            I will only select paths of length more than 3, as shorter paths do not have enough changes for the
            mental fatigue to be of any significance.
            I will also <strong>remove the last shift of finished paths</strong>, as this is a necessary to get to the target
            articles's category.
        </p>

        <img src="images/category_change_count.png"
            style="width: 600px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

        <p>
            <i>Maravilloso!</i>, the category shift per link <strong>is higher in unfinished paths</strong> (t-test significant for each path length) which shows
            that a higher shift correlates with increased cognitive load and thus greater difficulty.
        </p>

        <div class="content">

                <span class="image left"><img src="images/cajal_face.png" /></span>
                Indeed that seems to be the case, however <strong>are you sure that changes in category is the best
                    metric for measuring cognitive shifting</strong>?
                Articles who have the same category could be completely unrelated, take for example Alexander the Great
                and Einstein.
                These two articles have category "People" but have close to nothing in common.
                <!-- Now take Einstein and Physics, these articles have category "People" and "Physics" respectively, but are
                very closely related. -->
                Furthermore, are you sure you should be <strong>removing the final shift in finished paths?</strong>
                It is necessary, but still represents a change in category that should be accounted for if we consider
                cognitive load.
                In addition, the difference in cognitive shift appears to be 1 across all path lengths, 
                which aligns with the value you have subtracted. 
                This suggests that the <strong>initial data manipulation might be compromising your conclusions.</strong>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Semantic Shift</h2>


        <div class="content">

                <span class="image left"><img src="images/pepito.jpg" /></span>
                A potentially more meaninigul metric I can use is <strong>semantic shift</strong>, which I define as one
                minus the semantic similarity between two successive articles.
                <strong>Large semantic shifts</strong> between articles can represent a <strong>higher cognitive
                    load</strong> for the player, having to completely change topics from one article to the other.
                I can investigate if this is related to whether the path is finished or not.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px; text-align: center;">
            <button data-overlay-id="semantic-similarity" class="button big wide smooth-scroll-middle">About Semantic
                Similarity</button>
        </div>

        <p>
            Firstly, I will show how the semantic shift evolves over a path, by examining the semantic shift between
            articles in paths of different lengths.
        </p>

        <img src="images/semantic_shift.png" style="width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

        <p>
            As can be seen, <strong>semantic shift decreases at the end of finished paths compared to unfinished paths,
                which tend to stagnate</strong> .
            This indicates that, in unfinished paths, the gap in similarity between consecutive articles remains
            constant, suggesting that the player is "lost"â€”continuing to change semantic fields without converging on
            the correct target.
            This pattern supports my thesis that higher cognitive shiftings are indeed associated with a greater
            likelihood of path abandonment.
        </p>

        <!-- <img src="images/semantic_shift_hist.png"
            style="width: 700px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

        <p>
            We can observe that the <strong>semantic shift along finished paths is smaller than for unfinished
                paths</strong> indicating that finished paths tend to follow more closely related articles than
            unfinished ones.
            This supports the idea that jumping between articles with high differences in similarity can lead to
            unfinished paths, thus supporting my thesis.
        </p> -->

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                <span class="image left"><img src="images/cajal_face.png" /></span>
                Unfortunately, your thesis is not sufficient. 
                Even if the difference is statistically significant, as can be observed, the similarity inferred between the finished and unfinished paths 
                remains small (around 0.025). 
                This value is <strong>too small</strong> to infer a meaningful change.
                <br>
                In addition, have you considered the fact that this slight difference in semantic shift is probably due to the
                <strong>nature of finished paths</strong>?
                The last few articles in a finished path tend to be semantically close as the player is refining his search towards the target.                
                <!-- On the contrary, unfinished paths do not get this final homing in phase, so have slightly higher
                semantic shift. -->
            </p>

                <h1> Semantic Similarity </h1>

                <p>
                    <strong>Semantic similarity</strong> refers to the degree to which two concepts, words, or phrases
                    are related in meaning, even if they are not identical.
                    In essence, it allows us to evaluate <strong>how similar words or sentences based on their
                        meanings</strong> rather than exact matches.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To quantify this value, Pepito is going to use <strong>SentenceTransformer</strong> a model that
                    specializes in measuring semantic similarity by transforming sentences or words into
                    high-dimensional vectors, which then allows for easy comparison of their meanings.
                </p>

                <img src="images/semantic_similarity_example.png" style="width: 500px; height: auto">

                <p>
                    To ensure he understands how this metric works, Pepito is testing the model on a subset of words.
                    The results are <strong>generally intuitive</strong>: for example, "William Shakespeare" is
                    semantically close to terms like "playwright" and "Romeo and Juliet" but has no relationship to
                    "data analysis."
                    However, <strong>the model isn't perfect</strong>; it struggles with more nuanced relationships,
                    such as between "Romeo and Juliet" and "love," which one might expect to be closely related but are
                    not always picked up as such by the model.
