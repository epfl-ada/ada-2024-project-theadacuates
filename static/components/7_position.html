        <h2>Pepito's Brainstorm: Article Structure</h2>

        <p>
            After a long conversation with Dr. Cajal, Pepito begins to fear his defeat.
            Fortunately, <b>Cajal has to leave for two hours</b> to attend a conference, leaving Pepito on his own.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>"This is fantastic"</b>, thinks Pepito. He realizes he can use this time to come up with new ideas to
            propose. During this time, he identifies two brilliant potential investigations:
            <strong>the role of structural elements in the webpage</strong> and the <strong>position of links</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's follow his mental process and observe <b>if he can uncover something meaningful to present to Dr.
                Cajal.</b>
        </p>

        <h2>Structural Elements Catch Human Attention</h2>

        <span class="image left"><img src="images/pepito.jpg"></span>
        <p>
            It’s well-established that human <b>attention is drawn to colors and images</b><a
                href="https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2193355" target="_blank">(Ref)</a>.
            I believe that during the game, players are <b>biased toward clicking links near images or other elements
                rather than plain text</b>.
            As a result, they may end up selecting links that don’t necessarily move them closer to their goal, leading
            them off course.
        </p>


        <div style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px; text-align: center;">
            <button data-overlay-id="structural-elements" class="button big wide smooth-scroll-middle">HTML Structural
                Elements</button>
        </div>

        <p>
            In the image on the left, I have plotted how frequently a clicked link was found inside a specific structural element.
            <!-- structural element. When a clicked link appears in multiple positions on a page and it is unclear which one
            the user clicked, I <b>assume that users have no bias and that the probability of clicking each position is
                equal</b>. The number of clicks is then calculated using the <b>mathematical expectation</b>. -->
            <b>After normalizing</b> by the total number of links in each category, it becomes evident that people
            <b>tend to click on infoboxes</b> (which almost always include an image).
            This strongly supports my argument that visually prominent elements attract more player attention and
            clicks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Naturally, to validate my hypothesis, I need to show that there is a difference in the distribution between
            finished and unfinished paths.
            If visually prominent elements truly distract players from the target, <b>I should see more of these
                elements being clicked in unfinished paths</b>. <br>
            And... ohhh, if we look at the plot on the right, it seems that this <b>is indeed the case!</b>
        </p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-6">
                <div id="img-category-all-links" style="width: 40vw;height:30vw;"></div>

        </div>


        <p>
            Naturally, as Dr. Cajal taught me, <strong>visual appearance alone is not sufficient</strong>; I must
            perform a statistical test.
            I chose to use the <strong>two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test</strong> to determine if there is a
            significant difference in the distribution of clicks across finished and unfinished paths.
            Unfortunately, the test </strong>results are negative (p-value > 0.05)</strong>. Therefore, even though I
            may be clicking on an infobox,
            <strong>I have the same likelihood of completing or not my path</strong>. <br>
            <strong style="font-size: 24px;">I must hide this result from Dr. Cajal!!!</strong>

            <h2>Link Position & Human Laziness</h2>

            <p>
                Humans are inherently lazy and have <b>evolved to minimize the energy spent on tasks</b>.
                I believe this behavior applies to the Wikispeedia game as well.
                I hypothesize that players are <b>more likely to click on links that appear at the top of the page</b>,
                as scrolling down and searching for information on a new page requires more time and effort. 

                <br>

                The image on the left shows the <b>expected distribution</b> of link clicks, if they were all clicked with equal probability. 
                In contrast, the image on the right depicts the <b>actual distribution</b> of the position of clicked links in played games.
                As evident from the data, people tend to click more frequently on the initial links. 
            </p>

                To do so I will 
                Based on this figure and the results of the KS-Test hypothesis test, I believe my assumption is correct.
                Therefore, I can propose a new hypothesis: unfinished paths have the positions of clicks more skewed
                toward the start of the page.

                Now I have still to verify that there is a difference between finished and unfinished paths.
                Unfortunately, once again, the <b>KS-Test resulted in non-significant output</b>. 
                <br> The distribution of clicked target links in finished and unfinished records is nearly identical.

                <h2>How Link Position is Quantified?</h2>

                <p>
                    Since <b>monitor resolution cannot be inferred from our dataset</b>, we cannot assume it is the same
                    for every player.
                    Therefore, we are unable to determine the exact visual position of a link on a webpage a priori.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we decided to use the <b>order of link appearance on the page as a metric for position</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, we assume that users exhibit no bias in their selection of links, and all links on a page
                    have an equal probability of being clicked. If users have no bias toward link positions, the
                    distribution of clicked links should resemble
                    the distribution of all links on the page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For instance, when analyzing the distribution of all link positions on a page, if there is only one
                    link, we assign a weight of 1 to the link at position 1. If there are ten links, we assign equal
                    weights of 0.1 to links in positions 1 through 10.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a target link clicked by a user, if it appears in multiple positions on the page (e.g.,
                    positions 1
                    and 30), we consider the user to have clicked the link 0.5 times at position 1 and 0.5 times at
                    position
                    30.</p>

            <h1>Kolmogorov Smirnov Test</h1>

            <p>
                The Kolmogorov Smirnov test (KS-Test) is used to compare two distributions to determine if
                they are pulling from the same underlying distribution.
            </p>
            <p>Unlike other metrics that allow you to compare distributions such as JS divergence, PSI and KL divergence
                that come from mathematician Claude Shannon’s information theory, the KS-Test derives from statistics.
                <strong>It’s non-parametric, meaning it works across all types of distributions.</strong> Thus, it is
                not limited to use
                on well-known distributions such as normal or binomial – your data can take on any form, and the KS-Test
                still works.
