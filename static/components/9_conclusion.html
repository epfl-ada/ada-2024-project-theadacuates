        <h2>Pepito vs. Data: A Battle He Didn’t Win</h2>


        Pepito tested a variety of methods to validate cognitive overload and associated biases 
        but was <strong>ultimately unable to defend his argument</strong>. 
        The approaches he employed included:

        <b>
            <ul style="margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 auto; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Path Length and Duration</li>
                <li>Readability Metrics</li>
                <li>Shannon Entropy</li>
                <li>Graph Connectivity</li>
                <li>Cognitive Shifts</li>
                <li>Webpage Structural Elements</li>
                <li>Sentiment Analysis</li>
            </ul>
        </b>

        Despite these efforts, none of the methods provided conclusive evidence to validate his point.  
        It seems the poor results he achieved were <b>simply due to a lack of knowledge</b>, nothing more.
        
        <p></p>
        
        Pepito’s arguments were thoroughly dismantled by Dr. Cajals, 
        who employed <b>impeccable data analysis techniques.</b>
        Rather than dismissing Pepito outright, Dr. Cajals patiently listened to 
        his perspective and took the time to <b>teach him the principles</b> of conducting a robust and meticulous analysis.
